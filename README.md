# Express Installation Profile
The Express installation profile is developed and maintained by the University of Colorado Boulder where it is provided at no charge for college/school, academic and administrative department, and research group, lab and institute websites through the [Web Express service](http://www.colorado.edu/webcentral/). 

This is a customized installation profile of the [Drupal content management system](https://www.drupal.org/).  We maintain this publicly largely for other similar organization to reference. We do not support this code beyond working with developers employeed by other schools in the University of Colorado system or developers working with a vendor hired by an organization affilaited with the University of Colorado system. We do provide support for several key elements we've developed for Express, but contributed back to Drupal.org.  Those can be found at https://www.drupal.org/project/express

In addition to the Express install profile, Express sites add functionality by enabling bundles using Profile Module Manager. Actively maintained bundles include:

* Alumni Class Notes [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CuBoulder/cu_alumni_class_notes_bundle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CuBoulder/cu_alumni_class_notes_bundle)
* Campus News [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CuBoulder/cu_campus_news_bundle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CuBoulder/cu_campus_news_bundle)
